# Code
A suggested code checklist for good reproducibility practice.



- [ ] Code is under version control (public available)
- [ ] Metadata for comprehension (Readme are correctly filled)
- [ ] Code has a defined license (Change to you license choice)
- [x] Specifies Software Dependency (done in [binder/enviroment.yml](../binder/environment.yml))
- [ ] Code has DOI
   - [How to make software citable](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/credit.html#rr-credit-make-software-citeable) 
   - [ ] Code is cited under your publication
- [ ] Code quallity (Code review process)
- [ ] Code has unitesting
- [ ] Availability of training code
  - [ ] Does it need a new license?
- [ ] Availability of evaluation code
  - [ ] Does it need a new license?
- [ ] Availability of hyperparameters /  Sweep
- [ ] Availability of pre-trained models
  - [ ] Does it need a new license?

- [ ] Table of results is preset
  - [ ] Protocol (code) to execute the code to get the all the presented results
